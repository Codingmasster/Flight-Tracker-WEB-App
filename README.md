# Flight Search Application

This repository contains the code for a simple flight search application that allows users to search for flights from their current location to a specified destination on a chosen date.

**Features**:

User-friendly form to enter current location, destination, and date.
Basic search functionality using a placeholder API endpoint (replace with your actual API).
Displays search results as a list of flights in the HTML document (currently shows airline, flight number, and departure time).
Requirements:

A basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
An API key for a flight search API (consider using a free API from services like RapidAPI or Skyscanner).
Setup Instructions:

**Clone the Repository**:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/Codingmasster/flight-search-app.git
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Replace Placeholder Values:
In script.js, update YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key.
In script.js, update YOUR_API_ENDPOINT with the real URL of your chosen API's search endpoint. Ensure it accepts parameters for currentLocation, destination, date, and apiKey.
Run the Application:
Open index.html in your web browser, or use a local development server like Live Server ([invalid URL removed]).
Functionality:

Users enter their current location, destination city, and desired travel date in the form.
Upon clicking the "Search Flights" button, the fetchFlights function is triggered in script.js.
fetchFlights constructs the API request URL using the provided information and API key.
It fetches data from the API using fetch and handles potential errors.
If successful, the displayFlights function parses the API response and extracts relevant information like airline, flight number, and departure time.
displayFlights creates an HTML list element to display the search results in the #flights container.
**Customization**:

You can enhance the UI using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.
Implement error handling for user input or API response issues.
Tailor the displayed flight information based on the specific API response format.
Explore other flight search APIs for additional features or pricing data.
